-LinearEquation
Instance Variables:

private int x - x coordinate
private int y - y coordinate
private double y-int - y intercept coordinate
private double x-int - x intercept coordinate
private double distance - distance between the pair of points
Constructor:

public LinearEquation(int xcoord1,int ycoord1,int xcoord2,int ycoord2)
takes in both pairs coordinates
    checks that x1 doesn't equal x2
         Finds slope in fraction form , YIntercept()
            Puts information to y=mx+b form

private double slope()
        substitutes values into distance formula,
            return double slope

private double distance()
    substitutes values into distance formula, (d = √((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2))
        return double distance between 2 points

private int yIntercept()
    finds the y-int of the slope using one of the pairs
        return int y-int
Methods:

public String toString()
    prints the given two points, slope, y-int, the equation of the line, distance between the 2

public String coordinatePoint(int x)
    takes x value finds y value using linear equation.

EquationRunner.java

1. Ask user to enter first coordinate point
2. Ask user to enter second coordinate point
3. public String toString()
4. Asks the user for an x coordinate , gives back the y coordinate that x value lies on
